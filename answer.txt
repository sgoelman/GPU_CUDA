1 times
What is the memory-access to floating-point computation ratio in each thread? 
Consider a multiply and addition as separate operations, and ignore the storing of the result. Only global memory loads should be counted towards your off-chip bandwidth

each thread load 2 cell to memory  and do 64 command (multiply and addiation -> 32 multply and 32 addiation for each vector (block size) multipication ) then the ratio is 1:32
